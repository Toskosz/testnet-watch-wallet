# Bitcoin Testnet Watch Wallet

A Docker-based system for managing Bitcoin testnet addresses and transactions, consisting of three main components:

## Components

### Faucet Service

-   Generates new Bitcoin testnet addresses
-   Stores address information in a persistent database
-   Manages BTC transactions between addresses via a local Bitcoin node

### Watcher Service

-   Monitors addresses generated by the faucet service
-   Tracks transactions and balance changes
-   Provides real-time updates on address activity

### Bitcoin Node

-   Runs a local Bitcoin testnet node
-   Provides RPC interface for transaction management
-   Ensures reliable network connectivity

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Run the following command to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration

The services are configured through environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file:

-   `RPC_URL`: Bitcoin node RPC endpoint (default: http://bitcoin:18332)
-   `RPC_USER`: RPC username (default: user)
-   `RPC_PASS`: RPC password (default: pass)

## Data Persistence

The system uses two Docker volumes for data persistence:

-   `bitcoin-data`: Stores Bitcoin node data
-   `faucet-data`: Stores faucet and watcher service data

## Network

All services communicate through a dedicated bridge network named `testnet-network`.

## Ports

-   Bitcoin RPC: 18332 (testnet)

## Development

Each component has its own Dockerfile:

-   `Dockerfile.bitcoin`: Bitcoin node setup
-   `Dockerfile.faucet`: Faucet service setup
-   `Dockerfile.watcher`: Watcher service setup
